# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms on Ultra-Faint Dwarf (UFDs) Galaxies

This work was done as an Undergraduate Researcher with the University of Virginia Near-Field Cosmology Group. 
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to analyze astrophysical parameters of UFDs of the Milky Way such as their metallicity, velocity gradient. 
There are two models applied where one does not apply the velocity gradient while the other model applies has the velocity gradient. The initial model is for comparison purposes with our applied model. The parameters of the Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies are then inferred from the corner plots.
